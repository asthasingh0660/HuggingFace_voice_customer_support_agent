Transformers
 
 
Transformers acts as the model-definition framework for state-of-the-art machine learning models in text, computer
vision, audio, video, and multimodal model, for both inference and training.
 
It centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. 
transformers
 is the
pivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training
frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, …), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, …),
and adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, …) which leverage the model definition from 
transformers
.
 
We pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be
simple, customizable, and efficient.
 
There are over 1M+ Transformers 
model checkpoints
 on the 
Hugging Face Hub
 you can use.
 
Explore the 
Hub
 today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.
 
Explore the 
Models Timeline
 to discover the latest text, vision, audio and multimodal model architectures in Transformers.
 
 
Features
 
Transformers provides everything you need for inference or training with state-of-the-art pretrained models. Some of the main features include:
 
Pipeline
: Simple and optimized inference class for many machine learning tasks like text generation, image segmentation, automatic speech recognition, document question answering, and more.
 
Trainer
: A comprehensive trainer that supports features such as mixed precision, torch.compile, and FlashAttention for training and distributed training for PyTorch models.
 
generate
: Fast text generation with large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), including support for streaming and multiple decoding strategies.
 
 
Design
 
Read our 
Philosophy
 to learn more about Transformers’ design principles.
 
Transformers is designed for developers and machine learning engineers and researchers. Its main design principles are:
 
Fast and easy to use: Every model is implemented from only three main classes (configuration, model, and preprocessor) and can be quickly used for inference or training with 
Pipeline
 or 
Trainer
.
 
Pretrained models: Reduce your carbon footprint, compute cost and time by using a pretrained model instead of training an entirely new one. Each pretrained model is reproduced as closely as possible to the original model and offers state-of-the-art performance.
 
 
 
Learn
 
If you’re new to Transformers or want to learn more about transformer models, we recommend starting with the 
LLM course
. This comprehensive course covers everything from the fundamentals of how transformer models work to practical applications across various tasks. You’ll learn the complete workflow, from curating high-quality datasets to fine-tuning large language models and implementing reasoning capabilities. The course contains both theoretical and hands-on exercises to build a solid foundational knowledge of transformer models as you learn.

Installation
 
Transformers works with 
PyTorch
. It has been tested on Python 3.9+ and PyTorch 2.2+.
 
 
Virtual environment
 
uv
 is an extremely fast Rust-based Python package and project manager and requires a 
virtual environment
 by default to manage different projects and avoids compatibility issues between dependencies.
 
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for 
pip
, but if you prefer to use pip, remove 
uv
 from the commands below.
 
Refer to the uv 
installation
 docs to install uv.
 
Create a virtual environment to install Transformers in.
 
 
 Copied
 
uv venv .
env


source
 .
env
/bin/activate
 
 
Python
 
Install Transformers with the following command.
 
uv
 is a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.
 
 
 Copied
 
uv pip install transformers
 
For GPU acceleration, install the appropriate CUDA drivers for 
PyTorch
.
 
Run the command below to check if your system detects an NVIDIA GPU.
 
 
 Copied
 
nvidia-smi
 
To install a CPU-only version of Transformers, run the following command.
 
 
 Copied
 
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
uv pip install transformers
 
Test whether the install was successful with the following command. It should return a label and score for the provided text.
 
 
 Copied
 
python -c 
"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-analysis')('hugging face is the best'))"

[{
'label'
: 
'POSITIVE'
, 
'score'
: 0.9998704791069031}]
 
 
Source install
 
Installing from source installs the 
latest
 version rather than the 
stable
 version of the library. It ensures you have the most up-to-date changes in Transformers and it’s useful for experimenting with the latest features or fixing a bug that hasn’t been officially released in the stable version yet.
 
The downside is that the latest version may not always be stable. If you encounter any problems, please open a 
GitHub Issue
 so we can fix it as soon as possible.
 
Install from source with the following command.
 
 
 Copied
 
uv pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
 
Check if the install was successful with the command below. It should return a label and score for the provided text.
 
 
 Copied
 
python -c 
"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-analysis')('hugging face is the best'))"

[{
'label'
: 
'POSITIVE'
, 
'score'
: 0.9998704791069031}]
 
 
Editable install
 
An 
editable install
 is useful if you’re developing locally with Transformers. It links your local copy of Transformers to the Transformers 
repository
 instead of copying the files. The files are added to Python’s import path.
 
 
 Copied
 
git 
clone
 https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git

cd
 transformers
uv pip install -e .
 
You must keep the local Transformers folder to keep using it.
 
Update your local version of Transformers with the latest changes in the main repository with the following command.
 
 
 Copied
 
cd
 ~/transformers/
git pull
 
 
conda
 
conda
 is a language-agnostic package manager. Install Transformers from the 
conda-forge
 channel in your newly created virtual environment.
 
 
 Copied
 
conda install conda-forge::transformers
 
 
Set up
 
After installation, you can configure the Transformers cache location or set up the library for offline usage.
 
 
Cache directory
 
When you load a pretrained model with 
from_pretrained()
, the model is downloaded from the Hub and locally cached.
 
Every time you load a model, it checks whether the cached model is up-to-date. If it’s the same, then the local model is loaded. If it’s not the same, the newer model is downloaded and cached.
 
The default directory given by the shell environment variable 
HF_HUB_CACHE
 is 
~/.cache/huggingface/hub
. On Windows, the default directory is 
C:\Users\username\.cache\huggingface\hub
.
 
Cache a model in a different directory by changing the path in the following shell environment variables (listed by priority).
 
HF_HUB_CACHE
 (default)
 
HF_HOME
 
XDG_CACHE_HOME
 + 
/huggingface
 (only if 
HF_HOME
 is not set)
 
 
Offline mode
 
To use Transformers in an offline or firewalled environment requires the downloaded and cached files ahead of time. Download a model repository from the Hub with the 
snapshot_download
 method.
 
Refer to the 
Download files from the Hub
 guide for more options for downloading files from the Hub. You can download files from specific revisions, download from the CLI, and even filter which files to download from a repository.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 huggingface_hub 
import
 snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id=
"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
, repo_type=
"model"
)
 
Set the environment variable 
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
 to prevent HTTP calls to the Hub when loading a model.
 
 
 Copied
 
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 \
python examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py --model_name_or_path meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --dataset_name wikitext ...
 
Another option for only loading cached files is to set 
local_files_only=True
 in 
from_pretrained()
.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 LlamaForCausalLM

model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
"./path/to/local/directory"
, local_files_only=
True
)

Quickstart
 
Transformers is designed to be fast and easy to use so that everyone can start learning or building with transformer models.
 
The number of user-facing abstractions is limited to only three classes for instantiating a model, and two APIs for inference or training. This quickstart introduces you to Transformers’ key features and shows you how to:
 
load a pretrained model
 
run inference with 
Pipeline
 
fine-tune a model with 
Trainer
 
 
Set up
 
To start, we recommend creating a Hugging Face 
account
. An account lets you host and access version controlled models, datasets, and 
Spaces
 on the Hugging Face 
Hub
, a collaborative platform for discovery and building.
 
Create a 
User Access Token
 and log in to your account.
 
notebook 
CLI 
 
Paste your User Access Token into 
notebook_login
 when prompted to log in.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 huggingface_hub 
import
 notebook_login

notebook_login()
 
 
Install Pytorch.
 
 
 Copied
 
!pip install torch
 
Then install an up-to-date version of Transformers and some additional libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem for accessing datasets and vision models, evaluating training, and optimizing training for large models.
 
 
 Copied
 
!pip install -U transformers datasets evaluate accelerate timm
 
 
Pretrained models
 
Each pretrained model inherits from three base classes.
 
Class
 
Description
 
PreTrainedConfig
 
A file that specifies a models attributes such as the number of attention heads or vocabulary size.
 
PreTrainedModel
 
A model (or architecture) defined by the model attributes from the configuration file. A pretrained model only returns the raw hidden states. For a specific task, use the appropriate model head to convert the raw hidden states into a meaningful result (for example, 
LlamaModel
 versus 
LlamaForCausalLM
).
 
Preprocessor
 
A class for converting raw inputs (text, images, audio, multimodal) into numerical inputs to the model. For example, 
PreTrainedTokenizer
 converts text into tensors and 
ImageProcessingMixin
 converts pixels into tensors.
 
We recommend using the 
AutoClass
 API to load models and preprocessors because it automatically infers the appropriate architecture for each task and machine learning framework based on the name or path to the pretrained weights and configuration file.
 
Use 
from_pretrained()
 to load the weights and configuration file from the Hub into the model and preprocessor class.
 
When you load a model, configure the following parameters to ensure the model is optimally loaded.
 
device_map="auto"
 automatically allocates the model weights to your fastest device first.
 
dtype="auto"
 directly initializes the model weights in the data type they’re stored in, which can help avoid loading the weights twice (PyTorch loads weights in 
torch.float32
 by default).
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
, dtype=
"auto"
, device_map=
"auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
)
 
Tokenize the text and return PyTorch tensors with the tokenizer. Move the model to an accelerator if it’s available to accelerate inference.
 
 
 Copied
 
model_inputs = tokenizer([
"The secret to baking a good cake is "
], return_tensors=
"pt"
).to(model.device)
 
The model is now ready for inference or training.
 
For inference, pass the tokenized inputs to 
generate()
 to generate text. Decode the token ids back into text with 
batch_decode()
.
 
 
 Copied
 
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_length=
30
)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[
0
]

'<s> The secret to baking a good cake is 100% in the preparation. There are so many recipes out there,'
 
Skip ahead to the 
Trainer
 section to learn how to fine-tune a model.
 
 
Pipeline
 
The 
Pipeline
 class is the most convenient way to inference with a pretrained model. It supports many tasks such as text generation, image segmentation, automatic speech recognition, document question answering, and more.
 
Refer to the 
Pipeline
 API reference for a complete list of available tasks.
 
Create a 
Pipeline
 object and select a task. By default, 
Pipeline
 downloads and caches a default pretrained model for a given task. Pass the model name to the 
model
 parameter to choose a specific model.
 
text generation 
image segmentation 
automatic speech recognition 
 
Use 
Accelerator
 to automatically detect an available accelerator for inference.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 pipeline

from
 accelerate 
import
 Accelerator

device = Accelerator().device

pipeline = pipeline(
"text-generation"
, model=
"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
, device=device)
 
Prompt 
Pipeline
 with some initial text to generate more text.
 
 
 Copied
 
pipeline(
"The secret to baking a good cake is "
, max_length=
50
)
[{
'generated_text'
: 
'The secret to baking a good cake is 100% in the batter. The secret to a great cake is the icing.\nThis is why we’ve created the best buttercream frosting reci'
}]
 
 
 
Trainer
 
Trainer
 is a complete training and evaluation loop for PyTorch models. It abstracts away a lot of the boilerplate usually involved in manually writing a training loop, so you can start training faster and focus on training design choices. You only need a model, dataset, a preprocessor, and a data collator to build batches of data from the dataset.
 
Use the 
TrainingArguments
 class to customize the training process. It provides many options for training, evaluation, and more. Experiment with training hyperparameters and features like batch size, learning rate, mixed precision, torch.compile, and more to meet your training needs. You could also use the default training parameters to quickly produce a baseline.
 
Load a model, tokenizer, and dataset for training.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

from
 datasets 
import
 load_dataset

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased"
)
dataset = load_dataset(
"rotten_tomatoes"
)
 
Create a function to tokenize the text and convert it into PyTorch tensors. Apply this function to the whole dataset with the 
map
 method.
 
 
 Copied
 
def
 
tokenize_dataset
(
dataset
):
    
return
 tokenizer(dataset[
"text"
])
dataset = dataset.
map
(tokenize_dataset, batched=
True
)
 
Load a data collator to create batches of data and pass the tokenizer to it.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 DataCollatorWithPadding

data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)
 
Next, set up 
TrainingArguments
 with the training features and hyperparameters.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=
"distilbert-rotten-tomatoes"
,
    learning_rate=
2e-5
,
    per_device_train_batch_size=
8
,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=
8
,
    num_train_epochs=
2
,
    push_to_hub=
True
,
)
 
Finally, pass all these separate components to 
Trainer
 and call 
train()
 to start.
 
 
 Copied
 
from
 transformers 
import
 Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset[
"train"
],
    eval_dataset=dataset[
"test"
],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

trainer.train()
 
Share your model and tokenizer to the Hub with 
push_to_hub()
.
 
 
 Copied
 
trainer.push_to_hub()
 
Congratulations, you just trained your first model with Transformers!
 
 
Next steps
 
Now that you have a better understanding of Transformers and what it offers, it’s time to keep exploring and learning what interests you the most.
 
Base classes
: Learn more about the configuration, model and processor classes. This will help you understand how to create and customize models, preprocess different types of inputs (audio, images, multimodal), and how to share your model.
 
Inference
: Explore the 
Pipeline
 further, inference and chatting with LLMs, agents, and how to optimize inference with your machine learning framework and hardware.
 
Training
: Study the 
Trainer
 in more detail, as well as distributed training and optimizing training on specific hardware.
 
Quantization
